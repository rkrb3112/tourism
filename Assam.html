                            Jharkhand are rice, dal and vegetables. Common meals often consist of vegetables that are
                            cooked in various ways, such as curried, fried, roasted and boiled. Many traditional dishes
                            of Jharkhand may not be available at restaurants. However, on a visit to a local village,
                            one
                            can get a chance to experience such exotic foods. Some dish preparations may be mild with

                            oil and spice content, although pickles and festive dishes may have such characteristics.

                        <p>The word "Jhar" means 'forest' and "Khand" means 'land' in various Indo-Aryan languages.
                            Thus
                            "Jharkhand" means forest land.
                            In the ancient period, in the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to
                            location
                            near Kark Rekha i.e. Tropic of Cancer. During the Medieval period, the region was known as
                            Jharkhand. According to Bhavishya Purana (1200 CE), Jharkhand was one of the seven Pundra
                            desa.
                            The
                            name is first found on a 13th-century copper plate in Kendrapada, Odisha region from the
                            reign
                            of
                            Narasimha Deva II of Eastern Ganga dynasty. Forest land from Baidhnath dham to Puri was
                            known as
                            Jharkhand.</p>
